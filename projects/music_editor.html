        <h4 class="capitalize">description</h4>
        <p>
          For Object-Oriented Design class, I created a music editor with using Java.
          With the music editor, a user can listen and watch representations of songs as they play. In addition, the user can add / remove notes for the music.
          This was the biggest software project I had accompolished at the moment and I learned a lot about different design patterns, utilization of MIDI with Java and creation of GUIs along with using Java Swing.
          This was good practice for me to get used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">Model-View-Controller(MVC)</a> architectural pattern.
          You can foud my code for this project at <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h4 class="capitalize">challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The object of the project was little overwhelming when I started this project as this seemed like a lot of work along with other classes,
          however, it was fun to play around with Java libraries and figure out how MVC architectural pattern works during completion of the project.
          It was hard for me to grab a concept of MVC and Java MIDI at first but I was able to figure out the issues after attending many office hours.
        </p>
        <h4 class="capitalize">future ideas</h4>
        <p>
          I think there are rooms for improvements for this project even though most of the features were implemented successfully.
          It would be helpful for the user if I can make the view changes the pane as it plays the song for visibility.
          Right now, it does not move along with red line when it passes to next pane.
