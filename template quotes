          You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed.
          The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone.
          You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people.
          The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am.
          <br />

          <strong>Salvatore</strong>: Who said that? Gary Cooper? James Stewart? Henry Fonda? Eh?
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Alfredo</strong>: No, Toto. Nobody said it. This time it's all me.
          <em><strong>Life isn't like in the movies. Life... is much harder</strong></em>.
